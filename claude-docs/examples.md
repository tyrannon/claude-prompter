# Claude Integration Guide - Usage Examples

This document provides comprehensive usage examples for the claude-prompter tool.

## üìö Usage Examples

### Example 1: After Creating a React Component
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "React todo list component with local storage" \
  --code \
  -l react \
  --complexity moderate \
  --task-type ui-component \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 2: After Building an API Integration
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "OpenAI API integration with error handling" \
  --code \
  -l typescript \
  --complexity moderate \
  --task-type api-integration \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 3: After Creating a CLI Tool
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "File processing CLI with progress tracking" \
  --code \
  -l nodejs \
  --complexity complex \
  --task-type cli-tool \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 4: General Architecture Discussion
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "Microservices architecture design" \
  --complexity complex \
  --task-type backend-service \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 5: Learning-Aware Suggestions (NEW!)
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "React state management with Redux" \
  --code \
  -l react \
  --complexity moderate \
  --task-type ui-component \
  --show-growth \
  --claude-analysis
```

This will analyze the user's previous sessions and show:
- üå± Learning Journey Progress (sessions completed, experience level)
- üéØ Recent focus areas from previous conversations  
- ‚≠ê Mastered patterns from repeated successful solutions
- üöÄ Growth opportunities in unexplored areas
- Growth-based suggestions that build on previous work

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Example

1. **User asks**: "Help me create a REST API with Express"

2. **You create**: Express server with routes, middleware, error handling

3. **You analyze**:
   - Topic: "Express REST API with CRUD operations"
   - Code was generated: Yes
   - Language: TypeScript/Node.js
   - Complexity: Moderate
   - Type: backend-service

4. **You run**:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js suggest \
     -t "Express REST API with CRUD operations" \
     --code \
     -l nodejs \
     --complexity moderate \
     --task-type backend-service \
     --claude-analysis
   ```

5. **Tool generates** suggestions like:
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Write API tests
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add API documentation
   - Set up database migrations

6. **User picks** a suggestion and continues the conversation

## üöÄ Advanced Integration

### Chaining Suggestions
After implementing a suggestion, you can generate new suggestions based on the updated context:

```bash
# First round: Basic API
-t "Express REST API"

# Second round: After adding auth
-t "Express REST API with JWT authentication"

# Third round: After adding tests
-t "Tested Express API with auth and CI/CD"
```

### Multi-Feature Projects
For complex projects with multiple features:

```bash
# Focus on specific aspects
-t "User authentication system in MERN stack" --task-type authentication
-t "React dashboard components for MERN app" --task-type ui-component
-t "MongoDB schema design for user system" --task-type database
```

## üîó Integration with Main Conversation

Always connect the suggestions back to the main conversation:

1. Reference what was just built
2. Show how suggestions extend the work
3. Explain the value of each suggestion category
4. Help users understand the progression
