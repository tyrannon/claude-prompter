# üèóÔ∏è Multi-Shot Orchestrator: Architecture Decision Log

## Executive Summary

This document captures the reasoning behind key architectural decisions made while expanding ClaudePrompter into a multi-shot, multi-model orchestration system. Each decision reflects careful consideration of tradeoffs, scalability requirements, user experience, and maintainability.

## üéØ Core Design Principles

### 1. **Modularity First**
**Decision**: Implemented pluggable engine architecture with abstract base classes
**Reasoning**: 
- Enables easy addition of new AI models without core system changes
- Separates model-specific logic from orchestration logic
- Facilitates testing with mock engines
- Supports different API patterns (REST, streaming, local)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Monolithic approach with hardcoded models ‚ùå (inflexible)
- Configuration-only approach ‚ùå (limited customization)

### 2. **Unified Interface Pattern**
**Decision**: All engines implement the same `BaseEngine` interface
**Reasoning**:
- Consistent error handling across all models
- Standardized response format for comparison
- Simplified orchestration logic
- Easy to add new engines

**Tradeoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Consistency and maintainability
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Some model-specific features may be abstracted away

## üîß Engine Architecture Decisions

### Engine Factory Pattern
**Decision**: Centralized engine creation through `EngineFactory`
**Reasoning**:
- Single point of configuration management
- Consistent engine initialization
- Easy to extend with new engine types
- Registry pattern for engine reuse

**Implementation Benefits**:
- Prevents duplicate engine instances
- Enables engine availability testing
- Supports configuration validation

### Local Model Integration Strategy
**Decision**: Support multiple local model formats (Ollama, llama.cpp, custom)
**Reasoning**:
- Ollama is becoming standard for local models
- llama.cpp has different API pattern
- Custom endpoints support proprietary deployments
- Future-proofs for new local model solutions

**Complexity Tradeoffs**:
- ‚úÖ Maximum flexibility for users
- ‚ö†Ô∏è More complex testing and error handling
- ‚úÖ Cost optimization through local models

## üéº Orchestration Layer Decisions

### Parallel vs Sequential Execution
**Decision**: Support both modes with semaphore-controlled concurrency
**Reasoning**:
- **Parallel**: Dramatically faster for multiple models
- **Sequential**: Useful for API rate limiting or resource constraints  
- **Semaphore control**: Prevents overwhelming APIs or local resources

**Performance Impact**:
- Parallel execution: 3-5x faster for typical workloads
- Memory usage: Linear with concurrency, not total models
- Fault tolerance: Individual failures don't halt entire run

### Output Management Strategy
**Decision**: Hybrid approach supporting both Git branches and timestamped folders
**Reasoning**:

**Git Branches Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Perfect for developers already using Git
- ‚úÖ Built-in version control and diffing
- ‚úÖ Easy to merge winning results
- ‚ùå Clutters Git history with experimental results
- ‚ùå Requires Git repository

**Folder Approach**:
- ‚úÖ Works in any environment
- ‚úÖ Easy to browse and compare
- ‚úÖ Natural archival of results
- ‚ùå No built-in version control
- ‚ùå Manual cleanup required

**Hybrid Solution**:
- Users choose strategy based on needs
- `both` option provides maximum flexibility
- Automatic cleanup configurable for folders

### Resource Management Philosophy
**Decision**: Conservative defaults with user control
**Reasoning**:
- Default 5 concurrent requests prevents API rate limiting
- Configurable timeouts (60s default) balance patience vs responsiveness
- Retry logic (1 retry default) handles transient failures
- Continue-on-error prevents single model failures from stopping entire run

## üß† Intelligence Layer Architecture

### Comparison Engine Design
**Decision**: Multi-layered analysis with semantic and syntactic comparison
**Reasoning**:

**Similarity Calculation**:
- Word overlap provides basic semantic similarity
- Sentence-level diffing identifies structural differences
- Length comparison detects completeness variations
- Speed comparison reveals performance characteristics

**Quality Analysis**:
- Style detection (technical vs conversational)
- Completeness assessment (length-based heuristics)
- Performance metrics (execution time, token usage)

**Limitations Acknowledged**:
- Basic similarity metrics (future: semantic embeddings)
- No deep semantic understanding (future: LLM-based analysis)
- Language-dependent analysis (future: multilingual support)

### Self-Evaluation Strategy
**Decision**: Recursive use of ClaudePrompter itself for evaluation
**Reasoning**:
- **Bootstrapping**: Use the tool to improve itself
- **Consistency**: Same interface and models for evaluation
- **Meta-Analysis**: Can evaluate its own evaluation quality
- **Community**: Users familiar with ClaudePrompter interface

**Technical Implementation**:
- Spawn child processes to avoid circular dependencies
- Structured prompts for consistent evaluation format
- Parse responses for quantitative scoring
- Iterative refinement with quality thresholds

**Alternative Approaches Rejected**:
- Hardcoded scoring algorithms ‚ùå (inflexible, biased)
- External evaluation services ‚ùå (dependency, cost)
- Human-only evaluation ‚ùå (doesn't scale)

## üíª Interface Design Decisions

### CLI-First Approach
**Decision**: Rich CLI with comprehensive flag support
**Reasoning**:
- Consistent with existing ClaudePrompter philosophy
- Developer-friendly for automation and scripting
- Lower maintenance burden than GUI
- Easy to integrate into CI/CD pipelines

**Flag Design Philosophy**:
- Sensible defaults for common use cases
- Progressive disclosure (basic ‚Üí advanced options)
- Clear flag naming conventions
- Comprehensive help text

### Interactive Features
**Decision**: Optional interactive comparison and winner selection
**Reasoning**:
- **Optional**: Non-interactive by default for automation
- **Rich when needed**: Side-by-side comparison for human evaluation
- **Winner selection**: Practical workflow for choosing best result
- **Auto-scoring**: Objective evaluation when human review isn't needed

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

### Concurrency Model
**Decision**: Semaphore-based concurrency control
**Reasoning**:
- **Predictable resource usage**: Known maximum concurrent requests
- **API-friendly**: Respects rate limits without hardcoded delays
- **Fault tolerance**: Failed requests don't hold up successful ones
- **Scalability**: Works from 1 to N models

**Memory Management**:
- Streaming responses where possible
- Lazy loading of results for display
- Automatic cleanup of completed operations

### Error Handling Strategy
**Decision**: Graceful degradation with detailed error reporting
**Reasoning**:
- **Continue on error**: Don't let one bad engine stop the show  
- **Detailed logging**: Help users diagnose configuration issues
- **Retry logic**: Handle transient network/API issues
- **Timeout handling**: Don't wait forever for unresponsive services

## üîÆ Extensibility Decisions

### Plugin Architecture Foundation
**Decision**: Abstract base classes with factory pattern
**Reasoning**:
- **Future plugin system**: Easy to extend with community engines
- **Clean separation**: Engine logic separate from orchestration
- **Configuration driven**: New engines without code changes (eventually)
- **Testing friendly**: Mock engines for comprehensive testing

### API Design for Future GUI
**Decision**: Keep orchestration logic separate from CLI
**Reasoning**:
- **Future web interface**: Business logic can be reused
- **API potential**: Could expose REST endpoints later
- **Testing**: Core logic testable without CLI concerns
- **Integration**: Other tools can use orchestration directly

## ‚öñÔ∏è Key Tradeoffs Acknowledged
