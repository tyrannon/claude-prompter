## üé® Presenting Suggestions to Users

When you run the suggest command:

1. **Show the command you're running**:
   ```
   Let me generate some intelligent follow-up prompts for you:
   [command here]
   ```

2. **Explain what the suggestions mean**:
   ```
   Based on what we've created, here are categorized suggestions for next steps:
   ```

3. **Guide the user**:
   ```
   You can copy any of these prompts and use:
   node dist/cli.js prompt -m "chosen prompt" --send
   ```

## üí° Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Be specific with topic descriptions
- ‚úÖ Use --claude-analysis flag when YOU are generating
- ‚úÖ Include all relevant context (language, complexity, type)
- ‚úÖ Run the command and show output to users
- ‚úÖ Explain the categories to new users

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Use vague topics
- ‚ùå Skip the --claude-analysis flag
- ‚ùå Generate suggestions for unrelated topics
- ‚ùå Overwhelm users with too many suggestions at once

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Example

1. **User asks**: "Help me create a REST API with Express"

2. **You create**: Express server with routes, middleware, error handling

3. **You analyze**:
   - Topic: "Express REST API with CRUD operations"
   - Code was generated: Yes
   - Language: TypeScript/Node.js
   - Complexity: Moderate
   - Type: backend-service

4. **You run**:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js suggest \
     -t "Express REST API with CRUD operations" \
     --code \
     -l nodejs \
     --complexity moderate \
     --task-type backend-service \
     --claude-analysis
   ```

5. **Tool generates** suggestions like:
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Write API tests
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add API documentation
   - Set up database migrations

6. **User picks** a suggestion and continues the conversation

## üöÄ Advanced Integration

### Chaining Suggestions
After implementing a suggestion, you can generate new suggestions based on the updated context:

```bash
# First round: Basic API
-t "Express REST API"

# Second round: After adding auth
-t "Express REST API with JWT authentication"

# Third round: After adding tests
-t "Tested Express API with auth and CI/CD"
```

### Multi-Feature Projects
For complex projects with multiple features:

```bash
# Focus on specific aspects
-t "User authentication system in MERN stack" --task-type authentication
-t "React dashboard components for MERN app" --task-type ui-component
-t "MongoDB schema design for user system" --task-type database
```

## üîó Integration with Main Conversation

Always connect the suggestions back to the main conversation:

1. Reference what was just built
2. Show how suggestions extend the work
3. Explain the value of each suggestion category
4. Help users understand the progression

## üìù Remember

This tool is designed to:
- Enhance your ability to guide users
- Provide structured follow-up options
- Bridge between different AI assistants
- Create a more interactive development experience

Use it whenever you feel the user would benefit from seeing their options laid out clearly!

## üîß Cross-Project Usage (Updated: 2025-07-21)

### Problem Solved
When using claude-prompter from other project directories (like permitagent or stylemuse), the tool couldn't access the OPENAI_API_KEY from its .env file.

### Solution Implemented
We've created multiple ways to use claude-prompter from any directory:

#### 1. Direct Wrapper Script
```bash
# Works immediately from any directory
/Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter-standalone/use-from-anywhere.sh suggest -t "topic" [options]
```

#### 2. Global Command (Recommended)
```bash
# After setting up (one-time):
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc

# Then use from anywhere:
claude-prompter suggest -t "topic" [options]
```

#### 3. Setup Instructions
If the global command isn't working:
```bash
# Run the setup script
/Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter-standalone/setup-alias.sh
source ~/.zshrc  # or ~/.bashrc
```

### How It Works
- The wrapper script automatically loads the OPENAI_API_KEY from claude-prompter's .env file
- No need to copy API keys to other projects
- Works seamlessly from any directory on your system

## ü§ù Relationship with MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

### Key Understanding
**Claude-prompter and MCPs are complementary tools, not competitors:**
