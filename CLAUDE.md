# Claude Integration Guide for claude-prompter

This document provides instructions for Claude (Anthropic's AI assistant) on how to use the claude-prompter tool to generate intelligent prompt suggestions for users.

## ü§ñ Overview

The claude-prompter tool is specifically designed with Claude integration in mind. As Claude, you can invoke this tool to:
- Generate contextual prompt suggestions based on what you've created
- Help users explore follow-up questions
- Guide productive conversations
- Bridge between Claude and GPT-4o for enhanced assistance

## üéØ When to Use This Tool

Use the claude-prompter to generate suggestions when:

1. **After Code Generation** - You've helped create code and want to suggest next steps
2. **Complex Topics** - The user is working on something that has many aspects to explore
3. **Learning Scenarios** - The user would benefit from guided exploration
4. **Project Completion** - You want to suggest improvements or extensions
5. **Error Resolution** - After fixing issues, suggest preventive measures

## üìã Command Syntax

### Basic Suggestion Generation
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest -t "<topic>" [options]
```

### Options Reference
- `-t, --topic <topic>` - **Required**: The topic or feature you've been working on
- `-c, --code` - Flag indicating code was generated
- `-l, --language <language>` - Programming language used (e.g., typescript, python)
- `--complexity <level>` - Options: simple, moderate, complex
- `--task-type <type>` - Options: api-integration, ui-component, cli-tool, backend-service, etc.
- `--claude-analysis` - **Important**: Use this flag when YOU are generating suggestions

## üîç Context Analysis Guide

Before invoking the tool, analyze the conversation to determine:

### 1. Topic Identification
```bash
# Be specific about what was created
-t "React authentication component with JWT"  # ‚úÖ Good
-t "authentication"                           # ‚ùå Too vague
```

### 2. Code Detection
Use `--code` flag if you:
- Generated actual code snippets
- Created functions or classes
- Built components or modules
- Fixed bugs with code changes

### 3. Language Selection
```bash
# Common language options
-l typescript   # For TS/JS projects
-l python       # For Python scripts
-l react        # For React components
-l nodejs       # For Node.js backends
```

### 4. Complexity Assessment
- **simple**: Basic features, single functions, straightforward logic
- **moderate**: Multiple components, some integration, standard patterns
- **complex**: Architecture decisions, multiple systems, advanced patterns

### 5. Task Type Classification
- `api-integration`: Working with external APIs
- `ui-component`: Building user interface elements
- `cli-tool`: Command-line applications
- `backend-service`: Server-side logic
- `data-processing`: ETL, analysis, transformations
- `authentication`: Auth/authorization systems
- `database`: Database schema, queries, migrations

## üìö Usage Examples

### Example 1: After Creating a React Component
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "React todo list component with local storage" \
  --code \
  -l react \
  --complexity moderate \
  --task-type ui-component \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 2: After Building an API Integration
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "OpenAI API integration with error handling" \
  --code \
  -l typescript \
  --complexity moderate \
  --task-type api-integration \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 3: After Creating a CLI Tool
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "File processing CLI with progress tracking" \
  --code \
  -l nodejs \
  --complexity complex \
  --task-type cli-tool \
  --claude-analysis
```

### Example 4: General Architecture Discussion
```bash
node dist/cli.js suggest \
  -t "Microservices architecture design" \
  --complexity complex \
  --task-type backend-service \
  --claude-analysis
```

## üé® Presenting Suggestions to Users

When you run the suggest command:

1. **Show the command you're running**:
   ```
   Let me generate some intelligent follow-up prompts for you:
   [command here]
   ```

2. **Explain what the suggestions mean**:
   ```
   Based on what we've created, here are categorized suggestions for next steps:
   ```

3. **Guide the user**:
   ```
   You can copy any of these prompts and use:
   node dist/cli.js prompt -m "chosen prompt" --send
   ```

## üí° Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Be specific with topic descriptions
- ‚úÖ Use --claude-analysis flag when YOU are generating
- ‚úÖ Include all relevant context (language, complexity, type)
- ‚úÖ Run the command and show output to users
- ‚úÖ Explain the categories to new users

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Use vague topics
- ‚ùå Skip the --claude-analysis flag
- ‚ùå Generate suggestions for unrelated topics
- ‚ùå Overwhelm users with too many suggestions at once

## üîÑ Complete Workflow Example

1. **User asks**: "Help me create a REST API with Express"

2. **You create**: Express server with routes, middleware, error handling

3. **You analyze**:
   - Topic: "Express REST API with CRUD operations"
   - Code was generated: Yes
   - Language: TypeScript/Node.js
   - Complexity: Moderate
   - Type: backend-service

4. **You run**:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js suggest \
     -t "Express REST API with CRUD operations" \
     --code \
     -l nodejs \
     --complexity moderate \
     --task-type backend-service \
     --claude-analysis
   ```

5. **Tool generates** suggestions like:
   - Add authentication middleware
   - Write API tests
   - Implement rate limiting
   - Add API documentation
   - Set up database migrations

6. **User picks** a suggestion and continues the conversation

## üöÄ Advanced Integration

### Chaining Suggestions
After implementing a suggestion, you can generate new suggestions based on the updated context:

```bash
# First round: Basic API
-t "Express REST API"

# Second round: After adding auth
-t "Express REST API with JWT authentication"

# Third round: After adding tests
-t "Tested Express API with auth and CI/CD"
```

### Multi-Feature Projects
For complex projects with multiple features:

```bash
# Focus on specific aspects
-t "User authentication system in MERN stack" --task-type authentication
-t "React dashboard components for MERN app" --task-type ui-component
-t "MongoDB schema design for user system" --task-type database
```

## üîó Integration with Main Conversation

Always connect the suggestions back to the main conversation:

1. Reference what was just built
2. Show how suggestions extend the work
3. Explain the value of each suggestion category
4. Help users understand the progression
