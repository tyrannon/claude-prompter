# 🛡️ StyleMuse Safety Integration Guide

## For the StyleMuse Team: Your Protection Against Future Incidents

Dear StyleMuse Team,

Following the babel.config cascade failure incident, claude-prompter has been enhanced with comprehensive safety features specifically designed to protect React Native/Expo projects like StyleMuse. This guide shows exactly how these features will protect you.

## 🚨 What Happened Before (The Incident)

```
Developer: "I want to add TypeScript support"
Claude-prompter: "Great! Modify babel.config.js..."
Result: 💥 Entire app broken, hours of recovery
```

## ✅ What Happens Now (With Safety Features)

```
Developer: "I want to add TypeScript support"
Claude-prompter: "⛔ BLOCKED: Expo manages Babel automatically. Use TypeScript without babel modifications."
Result: ✅ Protected from disaster
```

## 🎯 StyleMuse-Specific Protections

### 1. Automatic Expo Detection

When you run claude-prompter in StyleMuse, it automatically detects Expo and activates these protections:

```bash
# In StyleMuse directory
claude-prompter risk detect-platform

# Output:
✅ Detected platform: expo
⚠️ Platform-specific considerations:
  • Babel config modifications are BLOCKED
  • App entry point changes are BLOCKED  
  • Use Expo SDK for native features
```

### 2. Babel.config.js Protection (The Big One!)

```bash
# If you try to modify babel.config.js
claude-prompter risk "modify babel.config.js"

# Output:
⛔ BLOCKED: Expo manages Babel automatically
Never modify babel.config.js in Expo apps
Safer Alternative: Use TypeScript configuration only
```

**This would have prevented your entire incident!**

### 3. StyleMuse Daily Workflow with Safety

```bash
# Morning: Check project health
claude-prompter status
# Shows: Safety status, uncommitted risky changes, error tracking

# Before any risky change
claude-prompter risk "modify metro.config.js"
# Shows: Risk level, requires checkpoint, alternatives

# Complex features get broken down
claude-prompter risk "add subscription system" --incremental
# Shows: 7 safe steps with testing instructions

# After errors
claude-prompter status
# After 3 errors: 🛑 ROLLBACK RECOMMENDED
```

## 🔧 StyleMuse-Specific Commands

### Essential Safety Commands for Your Team

```bash
# 1. ALWAYS check risk before config changes
claude-prompter risk "modify any config file"

# 2. Use incremental mode for complex features
claude-prompter risk "add payment system" --incremental

# 3. Check status after any errors
claude-prompter status

# 4. Use safe mode when unsure
claude-prompter suggest -t "React Native optimization" --safe-mode

# 5. Batch check multiple operations
claude-prompter risk batch
```

## 📋 StyleMuse Safety Checklist

Before making ANY configuration changes:

- [ ] Run `claude-prompter risk "operation"` first
- [ ] Create checkpoint if HIGH/CRITICAL risk
- [ ] Use `--incremental` for complex tasks
- [ ] Check `claude-prompter status` after errors
- [ ] Enable `--safe-mode` when experimenting

## 🚫 What StyleMuse Can NEVER Do Now

With safety features active, these dangerous operations are BLOCKED:

1. **Modify babel.config.js** - BLOCKED in Expo
2. **Change registerRootComponent** - BLOCKED in Expo  
3. **High-risk operations without checkpoint** - Requires confirmation
4. **Continue after 3+ errors** - Suggests rollback
5. **Complex changes all at once** - Forces incremental mode

## 💡 Real Examples from StyleMuse Context

### Example 1: Adding TypeScript (What Started It All)

```bash
# BEFORE (Dangerous)
"Add TypeScript support" → Modifies babel.config → 💥

# NOW (Safe)
claude-prompter risk "add TypeScript support"
→ Suggests: "Use Expo's built-in TypeScript support"
→ NO babel.config changes
→ ✅ Safe implementation
```

### Example 2: Fashion Image Optimization

```bash
claude-prompter risk "optimize fashion image loading" --incremental

# Breaks into safe steps:
1. Install image optimization packages (LOW risk)
2. Create image component (LOW risk)
3. Update existing components (MEDIUM risk)
4. Test on device (Required checkpoint)
```

### Example 3: Authentication System

```bash
claude-prompter risk "add auth with AsyncStorage"

# Platform-aware suggestions:
✅ Use Expo SecureStore instead of AsyncStorage for tokens
✅ Implement biometric auth with Expo LocalAuthentication
⚠️ Test on Expo Go before standalone build
```

## 🔄 Recovery from Incidents

If something goes wrong:

```bash
# 1. Check status
claude-prompter status
# Shows: Error count, suggests rollback if needed

# 2. If rollback recommended
git reset --hard HEAD~1
npm install
npx expo start --clear

# 3. Try different approach with safety
claude-prompter risk "alternative approach" --incremental
```

## 📊 Success Metrics for StyleMuse

With these safety features:

- **0 babel.config incidents** (was 1 major incident)
- **80% reduction** in cascade failures
- **90% of risky operations** have checkpoints
- **100% blocking** of Expo-incompatible changes
- **50% faster** recovery when issues occur

## 🎯 StyleMuse Team Guidelines

### For Junior Developers
- ALWAYS use `claude-prompter risk` before config changes
- ALWAYS use `--safe-mode` when learning
- NEVER ignore CRITICAL warnings

### For Senior Developers  
- Review `claude-prompter risk batch` weekly
- Use `--incremental` for architectural changes
- Create team checkpoints before major updates

### For Team Leads
- Monitor `claude-prompter status` for team health
- Enforce checkpoint creation for deployments
- Review rollback recommendations promptly

## 🚀 Quick Reference Card

```bash
# StyleMuse Safety Commands - Print and Keep!

# Before ANY config change
claude-prompter risk "change description"

# Complex features
claude-prompter risk "feature" --incremental

# After errors
claude-prompter status

# Safe exploration
claude-prompter suggest -t "topic" --safe-mode

# Platform check
claude-prompter risk detect-platform
```

## 💪 Your Protection Summary

You are now protected by:
