### gpt-5 (gpt-5)
**Execution Time**: 13794ms\n\nTesting new defaults with all models typically involves several steps to ensure that the models are performing optimally with the updated configurations. Here's a general approach you can follow:

1. **Identify the Changes in Defaults:**
   - Document the specific changes in default settings for each model. This could include hyperparameters, architectural tweaks, or data preprocessing adjustments.

2. **Set Up a Controlled Environment:**
   - Ensure that you have a consistent testing environment where variables other than the defaults remain constant. This helps in isolating the impact of the new defaults.

3. **Baseline Performance:**
   - Run the models with their previous default settings to establish a baseline performance metric. This could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other relevant metric.

4. **Implement the New Defaults:**
   - Update the models with the new default settings. Ensure that the updates are correctly applied across all models.

5. **Run Tests:**
   - Execute a series of tests using a diverse dataset that the models are expected to handle. This should cover various scenarios to test the robustness and generalization of the models.

6. **Compare Performance:**
   - Compare the performance of the models with the new defaults against the baseline metrics. Analyze improvements or degradations in performance.
   - Look for changes in computational efficiency, such as time taken for training and inference.

7. **Analyze Results:**
   - Evaluate whether the new defaults lead to overfitting or underfitting.
   - Check for any unintended consequences or biases introduced by the new defaults.

8. **Iterate Based on Findings:**
   - If the new defaults do not perform as expected, consider adjusting the settings or exploring a hybrid approach combining old and new configurations.

9. **Document and Report:**
   - Document the findings, including metrics, any anomalies, and insights gained from the tests.
   - Prepare a report summarizing whether the new defaults should be adopted, including any recommendations for further adjustments.

10. **Deployment:**
    - If the new defaults are deemed beneficial, proceed with deploying the updated models to production environments, ensuring that any integration issues are addressed.

This approach ensures a thorough evaluation of new defaults across all models and helps in making informed decisions about their adoption.

### gpt-5-mini (gpt-5-mini)
**Execution Time**: 16385ms\n\nTesting new defaults with all models typically involves evaluating the performance and behavior of machine learning models using a set of predefined conditions or parameters. Here’s a general approach you might take to test new defaults across various models:

1. **Select Models to Test**:
   - Identify the different models you want to evaluate. This could include different types of models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks) or different versions of the same model.

2. **Define Default Parameters**:
   - Establish a set of default parameters for each model. These defaults should be based on best practices, common usage, or new settings you wish to evaluate.

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - Use a standardized dataset that is representative of the types of data the models will encounter. Ensure the dataset is clean, preprocessed, and split into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **Implement Testing Framework**:
   - Set up a testing framework to automate the training and evaluation process. This can be done using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

5. **Run Experiments**:
   - Train each model using the default parameters and evaluate their performance on the validation set. Record metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other relevant measures.

6. **Analyze Results**:
   - Compare the results across different models and parameter settings. Look for trends or significant differences in performance that could guide further optimization.

7. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Based on the results, you may want to refine the default parameters and test again. This iterative approach helps in fine-tuning the settings for optimal performance.

8. **Document Findings**:
   - Document the findings, including which defaults worked best and any insights gained from the testing process. This documentation can be useful for future reference and decision-making.

9. **Deploy**:
   - Once you’ve identified the best-performing defaults, you can deploy the models with these settings in production environments.

If you have specific models or setups in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the guidance to your needs.
