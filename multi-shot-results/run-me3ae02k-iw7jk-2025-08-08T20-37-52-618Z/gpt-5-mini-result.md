## Original Prompt
```
Test new defaults with all models
```

## Response
Testing new defaults with all models typically involves evaluating the performance and behavior of machine learning models using a set of predefined conditions or parameters. Here’s a general approach you might take to test new defaults across various models:

1. **Select Models to Test**:
   - Identify the different models you want to evaluate. This could include different types of models (e.g., linear regression, decision trees, neural networks) or different versions of the same model.

2. **Define Default Parameters**:
   - Establish a set of default parameters for each model. These defaults should be based on best practices, common usage, or new settings you wish to evaluate.

3. **Prepare Data**:
   - Use a standardized dataset that is representative of the types of data the models will encounter. Ensure the dataset is clean, preprocessed, and split into training, validation, and test sets.

4. **Implement Testing Framework**:
   - Set up a testing framework to automate the training and evaluation process. This can be done using libraries such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch.

5. **Run Experiments**:
   - Train each model using the default parameters and evaluate their performance on the validation set. Record metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other relevant measures.

6. **Analyze Results**:
   - Compare the results across different models and parameter settings. Look for trends or significant differences in performance that could guide further optimization.

7. **Iterate and Refine**:
   - Based on the results, you may want to refine the default parameters and test again. This iterative approach helps in fine-tuning the settings for optimal performance.

8. **Document Findings**:
   - Document the findings, including which defaults worked best and any insights gained from the testing process. This documentation can be useful for future reference and decision-making.

9. **Deploy**:
   - Once you’ve identified the best-performing defaults, you can deploy the models with these settings in production environments.

If you have specific models or setups in mind, please provide more details, and I can tailor the guidance to your needs.
