## Original Prompt
```
Test new defaults with all models
```

## Response
Testing new defaults with all models typically involves several steps to ensure that the models are performing optimally with the updated configurations. Here's a general approach you can follow:

1. **Identify the Changes in Defaults:**
   - Document the specific changes in default settings for each model. This could include hyperparameters, architectural tweaks, or data preprocessing adjustments.

2. **Set Up a Controlled Environment:**
   - Ensure that you have a consistent testing environment where variables other than the defaults remain constant. This helps in isolating the impact of the new defaults.

3. **Baseline Performance:**
   - Run the models with their previous default settings to establish a baseline performance metric. This could include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or any other relevant metric.

4. **Implement the New Defaults:**
   - Update the models with the new default settings. Ensure that the updates are correctly applied across all models.

5. **Run Tests:**
   - Execute a series of tests using a diverse dataset that the models are expected to handle. This should cover various scenarios to test the robustness and generalization of the models.

6. **Compare Performance:**
   - Compare the performance of the models with the new defaults against the baseline metrics. Analyze improvements or degradations in performance.
   - Look for changes in computational efficiency, such as time taken for training and inference.

7. **Analyze Results:**
   - Evaluate whether the new defaults lead to overfitting or underfitting.
   - Check for any unintended consequences or biases introduced by the new defaults.

8. **Iterate Based on Findings:**
   - If the new defaults do not perform as expected, consider adjusting the settings or exploring a hybrid approach combining old and new configurations.

9. **Document and Report:**
   - Document the findings, including metrics, any anomalies, and insights gained from the tests.
   - Prepare a report summarizing whether the new defaults should be adopted, including any recommendations for further adjustments.

10. **Deployment:**
    - If the new defaults are deemed beneficial, proceed with deploying the updated models to production environments, ensuring that any integration issues are addressed.

This approach ensures a thorough evaluation of new defaults across all models and helps in making informed decisions about their adoption.
