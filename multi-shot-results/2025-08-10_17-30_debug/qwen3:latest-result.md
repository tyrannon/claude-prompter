## Original Prompt
```
"debug
```

## Response
<think>
Okay, the user wrote "debug". They might be asking for help with debugging a problem, but the message is very brief. I need to ask for more details.

First, I should prompt them to provide more context. What kind of issue are they facing? Are they getting an error message? Maybe they're having trouble with a specific program or code.

I should also consider if they're using a particular programming language or platform. Different environments have different debugging tools and methods. Without knowing that, it's hard to give specific advice.

Additionally, they might not know how to describe the problem properly. I should encourage them to mention the error message, the steps they've taken so far, and what they expect to happen versus what's actually happening.

It's possible they're new to debugging and need guidance on basic steps like checking logs, using print statements, or stepping through code. Alternatively, they might be dealing with a more complex issue that requires specific tools or techniques.

I should keep the response friendly and open-ended to make them feel comfortable providing more information. Let me structure the response to ask for the necessary details without being too overwhelming.

It seems like you might be asking for help with debugging, but your message is incomplete. Could you please provide more details about the issue you're facing? For example:

1. **What kind of problem are you encountering?** (e.g., an error message, unexpected behavior, etc.)
2. **What language or tool are you using?** (e.g., Python, JavaScript, a specific framework)
3. **What have you tried so far?**
4. **What is the expected vs. actual outcome?**

The more context you provide, the better I can assist! üõ†Ô∏è
