## Original Prompt
```
As lead developer of ClaudePrompter, analyze our multi-shot testing findings: Local models (TinyLlama) achieved 70-80% quality at 0 cost with 2x speed, GPT-4o-mini provides 90% quality at 1/3 cost, and GPT-4o gives maximum quality at full cost. What are the top 3 implementation priorities and strategic decisions we should make based on these findings?
```

## Response
Based on the multi-shot testing findings, here are the top three implementation priorities and strategic decision points for ClaudePrompter:

1. Implement TinyLama (local model) at full cost to maximize quality. This will require significant investment in infrastructure and development resources.
2. Invest in GP-T-4o-mini, a more advanced local model that achieves similar quality as TinyLama at a quarter of the cost.
3. Consider scaling up to GP-T-4o, an improved version of GP-T-4o-mini, which will achieve even higher quality at full cost and potentially reduce total development costs.
4. Develop a more advanced global model capable of achieving optimal quality across all local models at full cost and scale it up as needed to meet increasing demand.
5. Ensure consistency in test results across different testing configurations and environments, particularly for models with more complex architectures or inputs.
6. Implement continuous integration and automated testing practices to ensure a high-quality product at every stage of the development process.
7. Emphasize user experience and customer feedback throughout all stages of development to improve quality and minimize defects.
8. Continuously evaluate and optimize test strategies based on feedback from users, stakeholders, and market trends to ensure maximum value for money.
