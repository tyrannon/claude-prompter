## Original Prompt
```
Test performance metrics collection: What are the key benefits of using TypeScript for large-scale applications?
```

## Response
Using TypeScript for large-scale applications offers several key benefits that can significantly improve the development process and the quality of the codebase. Here are some of the most notable advantages:

1. **Static Typing**: TypeScript's static type system helps catch type-related errors at compile time, rather than at runtime. This can prevent a large number of common bugs and reduce the need for extensive tests for type safety.

2. **Improved Code Quality and Maintainability**: With TypeScript, developers can define interfaces, enums, and type aliases, which makes the code more structured and easier to understand. This leads to better code quality and easier maintenance, especially in large teams.

3. **Enhanced IDE Support**: TypeScript provides excellent support for modern development environments. Features like autocompletion, type checking, and refactoring are greatly improved, which can enhance developer productivity.

4. **Better Refactoring**: The type system and tooling support in TypeScript enable safer and more efficient refactoring. This is critical in large-scale applications where changes can have widespread effects.

5. **Interoperability with JavaScript**: TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, which means it can seamlessly interoperate with existing JavaScript code. This allows for gradual adoption in existing projects and compatibility with a vast array of JavaScript libraries and frameworks.

6. **Scalability**: TypeScript's features, like namespaces and modules, help in structuring large codebases logically. This scalability is crucial for large applications where managing dependencies and file organization can become complex.

7. **Robust Tooling Ecosystem**: The TypeScript ecosystem includes a powerful compiler and a range of tools that integrate with popular build systems and deployment pipelines, simplifying the development workflow.

8. **Community and Ecosystem**: TypeScript has a large and active community, which means a wealth of resources, libraries, and tools are available to support development. It is also supported by major frameworks like Angular, and increasingly by others like React and Vue.

9. **Backward Compatibility**: TypeScript can compile to different versions of JavaScript, ensuring compatibility with older browsers while allowing developers to use modern JavaScript features.

10. **Documentation and Self-Documentation**: The type annotations and interfaces in TypeScript act as documentation for the codebase, making it easier for new developers to understand the system and contributing to better knowledge transfer within teams.

Overall, TypeScript can significantly improve the development experience and the quality of large-scale applications, making it a popular choice for many organizations.
