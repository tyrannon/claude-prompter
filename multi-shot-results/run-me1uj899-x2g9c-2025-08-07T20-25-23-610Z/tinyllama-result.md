## Original Prompt
```
Test performance metrics collection: What are the key benefits of using TypeScript for large-scale applications?
```

## Response
1. Low cost: TypeScript is a free and open-source programming language designed specifically for JavaScript development, making it an attractive option for developers who want to use TypeScript to write code.

2. Easy learning curve: TypeScript has a small syntax compared to other popular languages like Java or C++, making it easier to learn.

3. Faster performance: TypeScript uses JavaScript's built-in types and functionalities, allowing developers to benefit from the same type checking and error handling mechanisms as their main language. This means that TypeScript applications tend to be faster than those written in other languages with similar structures and syntax.

4. Higher code quality: TypeScript ensures higher code quality by enforcing best practices like strict typing, modularization, and consistent naming conventions. It also supports static analysis tools, which can help identify potential issues before they become a problem.

5. Cross-platform support: TypeScript is designed to run on both JavaScript and non-JavaScript platforms, making it an attractive choice for large-scale applications that require support across multiple platforms.

6. Large community of users: The TypeScript community has grown rapidly in recent years thanks to its popularity among developers who use JavaScript. This means that TypeScript applications tend to have a larger user base and are more likely to receive updates and bug fixes.

7. Interoperability with other languages: TypeScript supports a wide range of other programming languages, including C# and Java, which can make it easier to share code between different projects.

Overall, TypeScript offers several benefits for large-scale applications, including low costs, easy learning curve, faster performance, high code quality, cross-platform support, and a large community of users and developers.
