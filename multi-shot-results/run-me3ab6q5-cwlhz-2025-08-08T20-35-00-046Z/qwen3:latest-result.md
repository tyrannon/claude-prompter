What's the next priority feature for claude-prompter: Predictive AI, Natural Language Interface, or Plugin Marketplace? Give a 2-sentence recommendation.
```

## Response
<think>
Okay, the user is asking about the next priority feature for claude-prompter: Predictive AI, Natural Language Interface, or Plugin Marketplace. They want a two-sentence recommendation. Let me break down each option.

Predictive AI could enhance user experience by anticipating needs, making interactions smoother. But if the current system is already efficient, maybe the focus should be on something else. Natural Language Interface (NLI) is crucial for accessibility. If users find the current interface cumbersome, an NLI could make it more intuitive. However, if the platform is already user-friendly, maybe the priority is different. Plugin Marketplace expands functionality, allowing third-party integrations. This could be a big win for scalability and ecosystem growth. 

The user might be looking to improve usability or expand capabilities. If the main issue is user experience, NLI is key. If the goal is to grow the platform's capabilities, Plugin Marketplace would be better. Predictive AI is more about efficiency. Considering common priorities, maybe NLI is a good next step. But I need to check if there's a more pressing need. Alternatively, if the platform is already user-friendly, expanding with plugins could attract more developers and users. So the recommendation should balance between user experience and ecosystem growth. Maybe start with Natural Language Interface to enhance accessibility, then move to Plugin Marketplace for expansion. That makes sense for a two-sentence answer.
</think>

Prioritize the Natural Language Interface to enhance accessibility and intuitive interaction, as it directly improves user experience without requiring extensive technical expertise. Following this, a Plugin Marketplace would expand functionality and ecosystem growth, aligning with long-term scalability and community engagement goals.
