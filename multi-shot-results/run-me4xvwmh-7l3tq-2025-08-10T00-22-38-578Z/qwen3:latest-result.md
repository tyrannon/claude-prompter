## Original Prompt
```
"analyze
```

## Response
<think>
Okay, the user sent "analyze" but didn't specify what they want analyzed. I need to ask for more details. Let me think about possible scenarios. Maybe they want an analysis of a text, data, image, or something else. Since the query is vague, the best approach is to prompt them to provide specific information. I should keep the response friendly and open-ended to encourage them to clarify their request. Let me make sure to ask for the subject and any specific aspects they're interested in. That way, I can offer a more accurate and helpful analysis.

Sure! Could you please clarify what you'd like me to analyze? For example, are you looking for an analysis of a text, data set, image, video, or something else? Providing more details will help me give you a more accurate and useful response.
