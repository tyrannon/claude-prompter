Additionally, it's important to provide informative error messages and, if necessary, perform clean-up operations.

Here's a concise example:

```javascript
function parseJSON(jsonString) {
  try {
    const data = JSON.parse(jsonString);
    console.log("Parsed data:", data);
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Failed to parse JSON:", error.message);
    // Handle the error, e.g., by returning a default value or re-throwing
    return null;
  }
}

// Example usage:
const jsonString = '{"name": "John", "age": 30}';
const result = parseJSON(jsonString);
```

In this example, the `try` block attempts to parse a JSON string, and the `catch` block handles any errors that occur during parsing, logging an error message and returning `null` as a fallback.

Okay, the user is asking about best practices for error handling in JavaScript and wants a concise answer with one code example. Let me start by recalling what I know about error handling in JS.

First, the basic structure is using try...catch blocks. That's the standard way to handle exceptions. But there's more to it. What about using try...catch in functions, and maybe using the Error object to create specific errors?

Oh right, throwing errors with new Error() or custom error classes. But the user might be looking for something more than just that. Also, handling asynchronous code with try...catch isn't straightforward. Oh wait, with async/await, you can use try...catch blocks, which is better than promises' .catch().

Wait, the user wants best practices. So maybe mentioning specific patterns. Like, always using try...catch, not ignoring errors. Also, using specific error messages, and maybe logging errors. Oh, and using the Error object to capture stack traces.

But the user wants a concise answer with one code example. So I need to present a clear example that demonstrates good practices. Let me think of a common scenario. For example, handling an API call that might fail.

Let me structure the example. Let's say a function that fetches data from an API. Use async/await, wrap the fetch in a try block, catch errors, and maybe log them. Also, maybe use a custom error message.

Wait, but the user might not need the full example. Let me think of a simple example. Maybe a function that divides numbers, which could throw an error if the denominator is zero. Then using try...catch around it.

But perhaps a better example is handling an API call. Let me draft that. For example:

async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    const data = await response.json();
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error.message);
    throw error; // Re-throw to let the caller handle it
  }
}

This example uses async/await, checks the response, throws a custom error, and catches it to log and re-throw. That shows handling both network issues and parsing errors.

But maybe the user wants a more minimal example. Let me think. Another example could be:

try {
  someFunctionThatMayThrow();
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error.message);
}

But that's too basic. The user might want to see more best practices. For instance, using specific error types, or using the Error object.

Wait, the best practice is to use try...catch for synchronous code and async/await with try...catch for asynchronous code. Also, including meaningful error messages, and not swallowing errors. Also, using the Error object to capture stack traces.

So, the code example should include using try...catch, handling both synchronous and asynchronous code, and maybe using the Error object.

Alternatively, maybe a single example that covers both. Let me think. Let's have a function that does something synchronous, and another that's async. But the user wants one code example. So perhaps a single example that uses async/await and shows error handling.

Yes, the fetchData example I had earlier is good. It shows handling network errors, checking response.ok, throwing a custom error, catching it, logging, and re-throwing. That's a good example.

Another thing: in the catch block, it's important to log the error and then possibly re-throw it so that the error can propagate up. Also, using the error.message property is better than just the error object, but sometimes the full error is needed.

Alternatively, maybe using a custom error class, but that's more advanced. Since the user wants concise, maybe stick to the basic example.

So the answer would be to use try...catch blocks, handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors with async/await, and include meaningful error messages. The code example would be the fetchData function as I outlined.
</think>

Best practice for error handling in JavaScript is to use `try...catch` blocks for synchronous code and `async/await` with `try...catch` for asynchronous operations. Always include meaningful error messages and avoid swallowing errors.  

**Example:**  
```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch data:', error.message);
    throw error; // Re-throw to let caller handle it
  }
}
```  
This approach ensures robust error handling, clear diagnostics, and proper error propagation.
