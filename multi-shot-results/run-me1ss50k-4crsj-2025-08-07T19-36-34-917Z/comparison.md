   - **Compliance with Regulations**: Ensure that both local and cloud processing adhere to data protection regulations like GDPR or CCPA.

4. **User Experience**
   - **Seamless Operation**: Users should experience a seamless transition between local and cloud processing, with no noticeable degradation in service quality or speed.

### Success Metrics

1. **Cost Reduction**
   - **API Cost Savings**: Measure the reduction in API costs as a direct result of the hybrid approach, aiming for the projected 60-80% savings.
   - **Overall Cost Efficiency**: Evaluate the total cost of ownership, including local processing infrastructure, against the savings achieved.

2. **Quality and Performance**
   - **Output Quality**: Track the quality of outputs from both local and cloud processing to ensure they meet predefined standards.
   - **Response Time**: Monitor system response times to ensure that the hybrid approach does not negatively impact user experience.

3. **User Satisfaction**
   - **Feedback and Adoption**: Collect user feedback to assess satisfaction with the systemâ€™s performance and reliability.
   - **Usage Metrics**: Analyze user engagement and adoption rates, looking for increases in usage as a sign of system effectiveness.

4. **Operational Efficiency**
   - **System Uptime**: Ensure high system availability and minimal downtime, whether processing is local or cloud-based.
