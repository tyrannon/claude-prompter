```

## Successful Results

### gpt-4o-mini (gpt-4o-mini)
**Execution Time**: 6510ms\n\nTo add Qwen3 local model support to ClaudePrompter, the top three implementation priorities would likely include:

1. **Integration with Model Architecture:**
   - Ensure that ClaudePrompter can interface with the Qwen3 model's architecture. This involves understanding the input-output specifications, preprocessing requirements, and API calls or function signatures necessary to interact with Qwen3. It may also include modifying or extending existing code to accommodate new data types or model features.

2. **Model Configuration and Management:**
   - Implement a robust configuration system that allows users to easily switch between different model versions and settings. This might involve setting up configuration files, environment variables, or command-line options that define which model to use, how to load it, and any specific parameters required for running Qwen3 effectively.

3. **Performance Optimization and Testing:**
   - Optimize the performance of the integration to ensure efficient execution and response times. This includes testing the model under different scenarios to ensure stability and reliability. It might also involve profiling and optimizing code, managing resource allocation (such as memory and processing power), and ensuring that the model can scale appropriately with the workload.

These priorities will ensure that the integration is seamless, efficient, and user-friendly, providing a solid foundation for further enhancements and features.
