## Original Prompt
```
List 3 key benefits of hybrid AI systems
```

## Response
1. High-performance: Hybrid AI systems combine the best capabilities of traditional AI and machine learning (ML) to achieve high performance in complex tasks. By combining deep neural networks with classical machine learning algorithms, hybrid models can perform better than either alone.

2. Flexibility: Hybrid AI models are flexible, allowing for easy adaptation to new data and changing requirements. This flexibility is essential in many real-world scenarios where the need to adapt rapidly changes.

3. Cost efficiency: Hybrid AI systems can be more cost-effective than traditional AI solutions because they offer a more integrated, efficient solution. By combining the best of both worlds, hybrid models are better suited for organizations with limited budgets and resources.
