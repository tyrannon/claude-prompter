## Original Prompt
```
We've proven that multi-shot AI orchestration works amazingly well. Now we need to implement: 1) Performance metrics collection for all multi-shot runs, 2) SUPER intelligent model router that uses AI to analyze prompts and select optimal models, 3) Default hybrid online/offline strategy, 4) Real-time cost tracking. What's the optimal technical architecture and implementation sequence for these features in ClaudePrompter?
```

## Response
Here are the optimal technical architecture and implementation sequence for the features you mentioned:

1. Performance Metrics Collection: The multi-shot AI orchestration system should be able to collect performance metrics at each stage of a multi-shot run. This will provide insights into how well each multi-shot model performs and allow for adjustments in the future.

2. SUPER Intelligent Model Router: The SUPER intelligent model router should use AI to analyze prompts and select optimal models. This feature should be able to analyze multiple prompts simultaneously, identify which model is best suited for each prompt based on its performance metrics, and select the appropriate model for use in subsequent multi-shot runs.

3. Default Hybrid Online/Offline Strategy: The hybrid online/offline strategy should allow users to choose between online execution (where a user may see their prompts immediately) or offline execution (where prompts are displayed after execution of previous steps). This feature should be configurable and allow users to switch between the two modes based on their preference.

4. Real-time Cost Tracking: The real-time cost tracking feature should provide users with real-time information about the cost of executing each multi-shot run. This feature should be able to track costs for both online execution and offline execution, allowing users to compare the overall cost of executing different models in different modes.

In terms of technical architecture, here are some options:

1. Use a distributed system with multiple nodes (e.g., Nginx or Apache web servers) running ClaudePrompter. This will allow for scaling the system as needed while keeping the system highly available and resistant to failures.

2. Use a containerization approach (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to run ClaudePrompter on a server. This will provide greater flexibility in terms of deploying and scaling the system, while also allowing for better control over the individual components within the system.

3. Utilize caching mechanisms such as Redis or Memcached to store state data. This will allow for faster execution times when multiple prompts are executed simultaneously.

Overall, this technology architecture and implementation sequence should provide the optimal balance between performance, scalability, and user experience.
