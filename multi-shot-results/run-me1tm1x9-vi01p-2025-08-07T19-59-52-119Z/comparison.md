```
We've proven that multi-shot AI orchestration works amazingly well. Now we need to implement: 1) Performance metrics collection for all multi-shot runs, 2) SUPER intelligent model router that uses AI to analyze prompts and select optimal models, 3) Default hybrid online/offline strategy, 4) Real-time cost tracking. What's the optimal technical architecture and implementation sequence for these features in ClaudePrompter?

## Successful Results

### tinyllama:latest (tinyllama:latest)
**Execution Time**: 4674ms\n\nHere are the optimal technical architecture and implementation sequence for the features you mentioned:

1. Performance Metrics Collection: The multi-shot AI orchestration system should be able to collect performance metrics at each stage of a multi-shot run. This will provide insights into how well each multi-shot model performs and allow for adjustments in the future.

2. SUPER Intelligent Model Router: The SUPER intelligent model router should use AI to analyze prompts and select optimal models. This feature should be able to analyze multiple prompts simultaneously, identify which model is best suited for each prompt based on its performance metrics, and select the appropriate model for use in subsequent multi-shot runs.

3. Default Hybrid Online/Offline Strategy: The hybrid online/offline strategy should allow users to choose between online execution (where a user may see their prompts immediately) or offline execution (where prompts are displayed after execution of previous steps). This feature should be configurable and allow users to switch between the two modes based on their preference.

4. Real-time Cost Tracking: The real-time cost tracking feature should provide users with real-time information about the cost of executing each multi-shot run. This feature should be able to track costs for both online execution and offline execution, allowing users to compare the overall cost of executing different models in different modes.

In terms of technical architecture, here are some options:

1. Use a distributed system with multiple nodes (e.g., Nginx or Apache web servers) running ClaudePrompter. This will allow for scaling the system as needed while keeping the system highly available and resistant to failures.

2. Use a containerization approach (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) to run ClaudePrompter on a server. This will provide greater flexibility in terms of deploying and scaling the system, while also allowing for better control over the individual components within the system.

3. Utilize caching mechanisms such as Redis or Memcached to store state data. This will allow for faster execution times when multiple prompts are executed simultaneously.

Overall, this technology architecture and implementation sequence should provide the optimal balance between performance, scalability, and user experience.

### gpt-4o-mini (gpt-4o-mini)
**Execution Time**: 14709ms\n\nTo implement these features for ClaudePrompter, it's important to design a technical architecture that supports scalability, real-time processing, and adaptability. Here's a high-level outline of the optimal architecture and implementation sequence:

### Technical Architecture

1. **Modular Microservices Architecture**: 
   - **Performance Metrics Service**: Collects and stores performance data from all multi-shot runs. This could be implemented using a combination of log collection tools (e.g., Fluentd, Logstash) and time-series databases (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus).
   - **Model Router Service**: Uses AI to analyze prompts and select the optimal models. This service could leverage machine learning models trained on historical prompt data and model performance metrics.
   - **Hybrid Strategy Manager**: Manages the default online/offline strategy, deciding when to use local models versus cloud-based models. This can be implemented using a rule-based system initially, with AI enhancements over time.
   - **Cost Tracking Service**: Monitors and reports real-time costs associated with model usage, integrating with cloud service billing APIs and internal cost management systems.

2. **Data Pipeline**:
   - Use a robust data processing pipeline (e.g., Apache Kafka, AWS Kinesis) to handle data streams from various services in real time, ensuring that metrics and cost data are processed efficiently.

3. **AI Model Hosting**:
   - Leverage containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes) to deploy AI models and ensure they can scale according to demand.

4. **User Interface Dashboard**:
   - Develop a comprehensive dashboard using web technologies (e.g., React, Angular) to visualize performance metrics, cost tracking, and route configurations.

### Implementation Sequence

1. **Foundation and Infrastructure Setup**:
   - Set up the microservices architecture, ensuring that services can communicate effectively.
   - Implement the data pipeline for metrics and cost data streaming.

2. **Performance Metrics Collection**:
   - Develop the Performance Metrics Service to collect data on latency, accuracy, and throughput from multi-shot runs.
   - Integrate this service with the data pipeline to ensure real-time data processing.

3. **Cost Tracking Implementation**:
   - Develop the Cost Tracking Service to track real-time costs.
   - Integrate with cloud billing APIs and internal systems for accurate cost reporting.

4. **Model Router Development**:
   - Build the Model Router Service, starting with rule-based logic for model selection.
   - Train and integrate machine learning models to enhance decision-making based on historical data and performance metrics.

5. **Hybrid Strategy Manager**:
   - Implement the Hybrid Strategy Manager to decide when to use online or offline models.
   - Start with a simple rule-based approach and enhance with AI over time.

6. **Dashboard Development**:
   - Create a user-friendly dashboard to display metrics, routing decisions, and cost tracking.
   - Ensure that the dashboard provides actionable insights and allows for configuration adjustments.

7. **Testing and Iteration**:
   - Conduct extensive testing of each component, ensuring they work seamlessly together.
   - Iterate based on user feedback and performance data to optimize functionality.

By following this sequence, ClaudePrompter can be developed to efficiently handle multi-shot AI orchestration, providing enhanced performance and cost management capabilities.

### Technical Architecture

1. **Data Collection and Storage Layer:**
   - **Performance Metrics Database:** Use a time-series database like InfluxDB or a cloud-native solution like Amazon Timestream to store performance metrics. Metrics could include latency, throughput, success rates, and others.
   - **Logging and Monitoring:** Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or cloud-based solutions like AWS CloudWatch.

2. **AI-Orchestrated Model Router:**
