## Original Prompt
```
analysis on how to solve the two sum problem
```

## Response
The Two Sum problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target sum. Here is a detailed analysis of different approaches to solve this problem:

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Approach 1: Brute Force

#### Description
The simplest approach is to check each pair of numbers and see if they add up to the target.

#### Algorithm
1. Iterate over each element in the array with index `i`.
2. For each element, iterate over the subsequent elements with index `j`.
3. Check if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`.
4. If true, return `[i, j]`.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) because we need to check each pair.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we are not using any additional data structures.

### Approach 2: Two-Pass Hash Table

#### Description
Use a hash table to store the difference between the target and each element, allowing for efficient look-up.

#### Algorithm
1. Create a hash table (dictionary) to store the values and their indices.
2. On the first pass, populate the hash table with the elements of the array.
3. On the second pass, for each element `nums[i]`, calculate `complement = target - nums[i]`.
4. Check if `complement` exists in the hash table and is not the current index `i`.
5. If found, return `[i, hash_table[complement]]`.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) as each lookup and insertion in the hash table is \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the extra space used by the hash table.

### Approach 3: One-Pass Hash Table

#### Description
This is an optimized version of the two-pass hash table approach. As we iterate over the array, we simultaneously check for complements and add elements to the hash table.

#### Algorithm
1. Create an empty hash table.
2. Iterate over the array with index `i`.
3. For each element `nums[i]`, calculate `complement = target - nums[i]`.
4. Check if `complement` is already in the hash table.
   - If found, return `[hash_table[complement], i]`.
5. If not found, add `nums[i]` to the hash table with its index `i`.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because we make a single pass through the array with constant-time hash table operations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the hash table storing up to \(n\) elements.

### Conclusion

The one-pass hash table approach is the most efficient for solving the Two Sum problem, offering both optimal time and space complexity. It leverages the power of hash tables for fast look-up and insertion, making it the preferred method for large datasets.
