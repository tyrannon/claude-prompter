## Original Prompt
```
analysis on how to solve the two sum problem
```

## Response
The "Two Sum" problem is a classic problem in computer science and programming that asks you to find two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target number. The problem can be formally stated as:

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Output Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we return [0, 1].
```

**Approaches to Solve the Problem:**

1. **Brute Force Approach:**

   - **Idea:** Check each pair of numbers in the array to see if they add up to the target.
   - **Complexity:** This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) because you have to check each pair of elements.
   - **Implementation:**

     ```python
     def two_sum(nums, target):
         for i in range(len(nums)):
             for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                 if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                     return [i, j]
     ```

2. **Hash Map (Dictionary) Approach:**

   - **Idea:** Use a hash map to keep track of the numbers youâ€™ve seen so far and their indices. For each number, calculate the complement (i.e., `target - current_number`) and check if it exists in the hash map.
   - **Complexity:** This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time complexity, as it involves a single pass through the array, and \(O(n)\) space complexity for the hash map.
   - **Implementation:**

     ```python
     def two_sum(nums, target):
         num_map = {}  # to store the index of the numbers we have seen
         for i, num in enumerate(nums):
             complement = target - num
             if complement in num_map:
                 return [num_map[complement], i]
             num_map[num] = i
     ```

   - **Explanation:** As we iterate through the list of numbers, we compute the complement for each number and check if it is already in the hash map. If it is, we have found the two indices whose numbers add up to the target. If not, we store the current number's index in the map and proceed.

3. **Sorting and Two-Pointer Approach:**

   - **Idea:** Sort the array while keeping track of the original indices. Use two pointers to find the two numbers that add up to the target.
   - **Complexity:** This approach generally runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time due to the sorting step.
   - **Implementation:**

     ```python
     def two_sum(nums, target):
         nums_with_index = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]
         nums_with_index.sort()  # sort by the numbers

         left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
         while left < right:
             sum = nums_with_index[left][0] + nums_with_index[right][0]
             if sum == target:
                 return [nums_with_index[left][1], nums_with_index[right][1]]
             elif sum < target:
                 left += 1
             else:
                 right -= 1
     ```

   - **Explanation:** By sorting the array, you can use two pointers to efficiently find the two numbers. However, this approach requires extra space to keep track of the original indices and is less efficient than the hash map approach in terms of time complexity.

**Conclusion:**

The hash map approach is generally the most efficient way to solve the Two Sum problem in terms of both time and space complexity. It provides a straightforward solution that leverages the power of hash maps to achieve linear time complexity, making it suitable for large datasets.
