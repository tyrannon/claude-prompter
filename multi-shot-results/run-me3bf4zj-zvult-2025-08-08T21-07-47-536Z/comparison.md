### gpt-5-nano (gpt-5-nano)
**Execution Time**: 4771ms\n\nThe Two Sum problem is a classic algorithm problem where the task is to find two numbers in an array that add up to a given target. Here’s a step-by-step analysis of how to solve it efficiently:

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - **Description**: Check all possible pairs of numbers to see if they add up to the target.
   - **Implementation**: Use two nested loops to iterate over all pairs.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n²), where n is the number of elements in the array.
   - **Space Complexity**: O(1).

2. **Two-pass Hash Table**:
   - **Description**: Use a hash table to store the complement of each element (target - element) and its index.
   - **Implementation**: 
     1. Create a hash table.
     2. Iterate over the array and store each element's index.
     3. On a second pass, check if the complement exists in the hash table.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n).
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n).

3. **One-pass Hash Table**:
   - **Description**: Similar to the two-pass method but checks for the complement while inserting elements into the hash table.
   - **Implementation**:
     1. Create a hash table.
     2. Iterate over the array once.
     3. For each element, check if its complement is already in the hash table.
     4. If found, return the indices.
     5. Otherwise, add the element and its index to the hash table.
   - **Time Complexity**: O(n).
   - **Space Complexity**: O(n).

The most efficient approach is the one-pass hash table method, which achieves optimal time complexity while using additional space for the hash table. This solution is both time-efficient and relatively straightforward to implement.

### gpt-5-mini (gpt-5-mini)
**Execution Time**: 7402ms\n\nThe Two Sum problem is a classic algorithmic challenge that involves finding two numbers in an array that add up to a specific target sum. Here is a detailed analysis of different approaches to solve this problem:

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`. Assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

### Approach 1: Brute Force

#### Description
The simplest approach is to check each pair of numbers and see if they add up to the target.

#### Algorithm
1. Iterate over each element in the array with index `i`.
2. For each element, iterate over the subsequent elements with index `j`.
3. Check if `nums[i] + nums[j] == target`.
4. If true, return `[i, j]`.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) because we need to check each pair.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as we are not using any additional data structures.

### Approach 2: Two-Pass Hash Table

#### Description
Use a hash table to store the difference between the target and each element, allowing for efficient look-up.

#### Algorithm
1. Create a hash table (dictionary) to store the values and their indices.
2. On the first pass, populate the hash table with the elements of the array.
3. On the second pass, for each element `nums[i]`, calculate `complement = target - nums[i]`.
4. Check if `complement` exists in the hash table and is not the current index `i`.
5. If found, return `[i, hash_table[complement]]`.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) as each lookup and insertion in the hash table is \(O(1)\).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the extra space used by the hash table.

### Approach 3: One-Pass Hash Table

#### Description
This is an optimized version of the two-pass hash table approach. As we iterate over the array, we simultaneously check for complements and add elements to the hash table.

#### Algorithm
1. Create an empty hash table.
2. Iterate over the array with index `i`.
3. For each element `nums[i]`, calculate `complement = target - nums[i]`.
4. Check if `complement` is already in the hash table.
   - If found, return `[hash_table[complement], i]`.
5. If not found, add `nums[i]` to the hash table with its index `i`.

#### Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because we make a single pass through the array with constant-time hash table operations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) due to the hash table storing up to \(n\) elements.

### Conclusion

The one-pass hash table approach is the most efficient for solving the Two Sum problem, offering both optimal time and space complexity. It leverages the power of hash tables for fast look-up and insertion, making it the preferred method for large datasets.

### gpt-5 (gpt-5)
**Execution Time**: 8708ms\n\nThe "Two Sum" problem is a classic problem in computer science and programming that asks you to find two numbers in a list that add up to a specific target number. The problem can be formally stated as:

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Output Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so we return [0, 1].
```

**Approaches to Solve the Problem:**

1. **Brute Force Approach:**

   - **Idea:** Check each pair of numbers in the array to see if they add up to the target.
   - **Complexity:** This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\) because you have to check each pair of elements.
   - **Implementation:**

     ```python
     def two_sum(nums, target):
         for i in range(len(nums)):
             for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
                 if nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                     return [i, j]
     ```

2. **Hash Map (Dictionary) Approach:**

   - **Idea:** Use a hash map to keep track of the numbers you’ve seen so far and their indices. For each number, calculate the complement (i.e., `target - current_number`) and check if it exists in the hash map.
   - **Complexity:** This approach runs in \(O(n)\) time complexity, as it involves a single pass through the array, and \(O(n)\) space complexity for the hash map.
   - **Implementation:**

     ```python
     def two_sum(nums, target):
         num_map = {}  # to store the index of the numbers we have seen
         for i, num in enumerate(nums):
             complement = target - num
             if complement in num_map:
                 return [num_map[complement], i]
             num_map[num] = i
     ```

   - **Explanation:** As we iterate through the list of numbers, we compute the complement for each number and check if it is already in the hash map. If it is, we have found the two indices whose numbers add up to the target. If not, we store the current number's index in the map and proceed.

3. **Sorting and Two-Pointer Approach:**

   - **Idea:** Sort the array while keeping track of the original indices. Use two pointers to find the two numbers that add up to the target.
   - **Complexity:** This approach generally runs in \(O(n \log n)\) time due to the sorting step.
   - **Implementation:**

     ```python
     def two_sum(nums, target):
         nums_with_index = [(num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums)]
         nums_with_index.sort()  # sort by the numbers

         left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
         while left < right:
             sum = nums_with_index[left][0] + nums_with_index[right][0]
             if sum == target:
                 return [nums_with_index[left][1], nums_with_index[right][1]]
             elif sum < target:
                 left += 1
             else:
                 right -= 1
     ```

   - **Explanation:** By sorting the array, you can use two pointers to efficiently find the two numbers. However, this approach requires extra space to keep track of the original indices and is less efficient than the hash map approach in terms of time complexity.

**Conclusion:**

The hash map approach is generally the most efficient way to solve the Two Sum problem in terms of both time and space complexity. It provides a straightforward solution that leverages the power of hash maps to achieve linear time complexity, making it suitable for large datasets.
